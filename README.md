## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]


Often times, as developers, when we hear about a new techology or framework, we're excited to take advantage of all of the new features. With the latest announcement of the new Apple Watches and watchOS 3, we want to jump on to that bandwagon, but when it comes to working with WatchOS and creating interfaces for it, we have to learn how to use Complications. Fortunately, Complications in watchOS development aren't as difficult as the name makes it sound. 

In this course, you'll see you easy it is to work with Complications. You'll also learn how to integrate some very cool features into them to make your watchOS app even more useful to your end users. Follow along, as Envato Tuts+ instructor Derek Jensen builds a watchOS Complication with Time Travel.
